An attempt to build a nice little floor plan browser app, using D3.

Notes:

* Once past tidbit demoing, the idea is to use D3 as it should properly be used - for visualisations driven by DATA. So there will be data objects associated with plan elements when they are instantiated - i.e. length, width, area, material etc. This approach to the app will be useful for styling and potential info to show on hovers, clicks, summaries etc.
* Basic shapes are created on load for the selection panel - do these need associated data objects? any cost / benefit to having objects?
